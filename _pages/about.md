Hi, I am Hanqing Liu (刘翰青).

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Ecker lab](https://ecker.salk.edu/) at the 
[Salk Institute for Biological Studies](https://www.salk.edu/), 
where I got my PhD in Biology under the guidance of 
[Dr. Joseph Ecker](https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/joseph-r-ecker).
My research focuses on developing single-cell multi-omic technologies and analytical frameworks 
to investigate and decipher the epigenomic diversity of mammalian brains across spatial and temporal dimensions.

I got my BSc in Biotechnology from the Zhejiang University in China, 
graduating with honors from the Chu Kochen Honors College.

Starting in July 2023, I will be joining 
[the Society of Fellows at Harvard University](https://socfell.fas.harvard.edu/about) 
as a Junior Fellow.

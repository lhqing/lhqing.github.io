Hi, I am Hanqing Liu (刘翰青).

I am currently a Harvard [Junior Fellow](https://socfell.fas.harvard.edu/about) 
working with the [Greenberg lab](https://greenberg.hms.harvard.edu/) 
at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/).

Before joining Harvard, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Ecker lab](https://ecker.salk.edu/) at the
[Salk Institute for Biological Studies](https://www.salk.edu/),
where I got my PhD in Biology from UCSD under the guidance of
[Dr. Joseph Ecker](https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/joseph-r-ecker).
My doctoral research focuses on developing single-cell multi-omic technologies and analytical frameworks
to investigate and decipher the epigenomic diversity of mammalian brains across spatial and temporal dimensions.

I got my BSc in Biotechnology from the [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University) in China,
graduating with honors from the Chu Kochen Honors College. 
I also had one year clinical training at the Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 
before I decided to change my career path to basic research.

I grow up in [Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou), the capital city of Zhejiang Province in China. 
I enjoy taking photos and going to classical music concerts in my spare time.

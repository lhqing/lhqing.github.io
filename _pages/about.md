Hi, I am Hanqing Liu (刘翰青).

I am currently a Junior Fellow in the [Harvard Society of Fellows](https://socfell.fas.harvard.edu/about)
working with [Michael Greenberg's lab](https://greenberg.hms.harvard.edu/)
at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/). My research integrates large-scale single-cell genomics, molecular technology development, and computational modeling to understand how gene regulation is encoded in the genome and deployed across diverse brain cell states. I am particularly interested in activity-dependent gene regulation and how non-coding regulatory variation shapes brain development and contributes to psychiatric disorders.

Previously, I trained in [Joseph Ecker’s lab](https://ecker.salk.edu/) at the [Salk Institute](https://www.salk.edu/) and earned my PhD in Biology from UC San Diego, where I helped build and analyze single-cell multi-omic brain atlases spanning epigenomic and 3D genome layers. I got my BSc in Biotechnology from the [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University) in China, graduating with honors from the Chu Kochen Honors College. I also had one year clinical training at the Zhejiang University School of Medicine, before I decided to change my career path to basic research.

I grow up in [Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou), a beautilful city of Zhejiang Province in China. I enjoy enjoy photography and classical music in my spare time.

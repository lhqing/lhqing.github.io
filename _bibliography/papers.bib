  abstract  = "Cytosine DNA methylation is essential in brain development and
               is implicated in various neurological disorders. Understanding
               DNA methylation diversity across the entire brain in a spatial
               context is fundamental for a complete molecular atlas of brain
               cell types and their gene regulatory landscapes. Here we used
               single-nucleus methylome sequencing (snmC-seq3) and multi-omic
               sequencing (snm3C-seq)1 technologies to generate 301,626
               methylomes and 176,003 chromatin conformation--methylome joint
               profiles from 117 dissected regions throughout the adult mouse
               brain. Using iterative clustering and integrating with companion
               whole-brain transcriptome and chromatin accessibility datasets,
               we constructed a methylation-based cell taxonomy with 4,673 cell
               groups and 274 cross-modality-annotated subclasses. We
               identified 2.6 million differentially methylated regions across
               the genome that represent potential gene regulation elements.
               Notably, we observed spatial cytosine methylation patterns on
               both genes and regulatory elements in cell types within and
               across brain regions. Brain-wide spatial transcriptomics data
               validated the association of spatial epigenetic diversity with
               transcription and improved the anatomical mapping of our
               epigenetic datasets. Furthermore, chromatin conformation
               diversities occurred in important neuronal genes and were highly
               associated with DNA methylation and transcription changes.
               Brain-wide cell-type comparisons enabled the construction of
               regulatory networks that incorporate transcription factors,
               regulatory elements and their potential downstream gene targets.
               Finally, intragenic DNA methylation and chromatin conformation
               patterns predicted alternative gene isoform expression observed
               in a whole-brain SMART-seq2 dataset. Our study establishes a
               brain-wide, single-cell DNA methylome and 3D multi-omic atlas
               and provides a valuable resource for comprehending the
               cellular--spatial and regulatory genome diversity of the mouse
               brain. Methylome-based clustering and cross-modality integration
               with companion datasets from the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census

               accessibility in 2.3 million individual brain cells from 117

               million cCREs and their chromatin accessibility across 1,482
               distinct brain cell populations, adding over 446,000 cCREs to
               the most recent such annotation in the mouse genome. The mouse
               brain cCREs are moderately conserved in the human brain. The
               mouse-specific cCREs---specifically, those identified from a
               subset of cortical excitatory neurons---are strongly enriched

               transposable elements in the emergence of new regulatory
               programs and neuronal diversity. Finally, we infer the gene
               regulatory networks in over 260 subclasses of mouse brain cells

               gene regulatory elements in different brain cell types from the

               thousands of `cell-type' clusters residing in different brain
               structures1. Many cell types mediate their functions through
               targeted long-distance projections allowing interactions between
               specific cell types. Here we used epi-retro-seq2 to link
               single-cell epigenomes and cell types to long-distance
               projections for 33,034 neurons dissected from 32 different
               regions projecting to 24 different targets (225 source-to-target
               combinations) across the whole mouse brain. We highlight uses of
               these data for interrogating principles relating projection
               types to transcriptomics and epigenomics, and for addressing
               hypotheses about cell types and connections related to genetics.
               We provide an overall synthesis with 926 statistical comparisons
               of discriminability of neurons projecting to each target for
               every source. We integrate this dataset into the larger BRAIN
               Initiative Cell Census Network atlas, composed of millions of
               neurons, to link projection cell types to consensus clusters.
               Integration with spatial transcriptomics further assigns
               projection-enriched clusters to smaller source regions than the
               original dissections. We exemplify this by presenting in-depth
               analyses of projection neurons from the hypothalamus, thalamus,
               hindbrain, amygdala and midbrain to provide insights into
               properties of those cell types, including differentially
               expressed genes, their associated cis-regulatory elements and
               transcription-factor-binding motifs, and neurotransmitter use.

               Here we investigated the gene regulatory programs in the primary
               motor cortex of human, macaque, marmoset and mouse using
               single-cell multiomics assays, generating gene expression,

               conformation profiles from a total of over 200,000 cells. From
               these data, we show evidence that divergence of transcription

               Computational approaches allow the fusion of diverse single-cell

              properties, anatomy and functions. Although recent advances in
              single-cell genomics have led to high-resolution molecular
              characterization of cell type diversity in the brain1, neuronal
              cell types are often studied out of the context of their
              anatomical properties. To improve our understanding of the
              relationship between molecular and anatomical features that
              define cortical neurons, here we combined retrograde labelling
              with single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing to link neural
              epigenomic properties to projections. We examined 11,827 single
              neocortical neurons from 63 cortico-cortical and
              cortico-subcortical long-distance projections. Our results showed
              unique epigenetic signatures of projection neurons that
              correspond to their laminar and regional location and projection
              patterns. On the basis of their epigenomes, intra-telencephalic
              cells that project to different cortical targets could be further
              distinguished, and some layer 5 neurons that project to
              extra-telencephalic targets (L5 ET) formed separate clusters that
              aligned with their axonal projections. Such separation varied
              between cortical areas, which suggests that there are
              area-specific differences in L5 ET subtypes, which were further
              validated by anatomical studies. Notably, a population of
              cortico-cortical projection neurons clustered with L5 ET rather
              than intra-telencephalic neurons, which suggests that a
              population of L5 ET cortical neurons projects to both targets. We
              verified the existence of these neurons by dual retrograde
              labelling and anterograde tracing of cortico-cortical projection
              neurons, which revealed axon terminals in extra-telencephalic
              targets including the thalamus, superior colliculus and pons.
              These findings highlight the power of single-cell epigenomic

              Here, using high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic
              profiling of more than 450,000 single nuclei in humans, marmoset
              monkeys and mice, we demonstrate a broadly conserved cellular
              makeup of this region, with similarities that mirror evolutionary
              distance and are consistent between the transcriptome and
              epigenome. The core conserved molecular identities of neuronal
              and non-neuronal cell types allow us to generate a cross-species
              consensus classification of cell types, and to infer conserved
              properties of cell types across species. Despite the overall
              conservation, however, many species-dependent specializations are
              apparent, including differences in cell-type proportions, gene
              expression, DNA methylation and chromatin state. Few cell-type
              marker genes are conserved across species, revealing a short list
              of candidate genes and regulatory mechanisms that are responsible
              for conserved features of homologous cell types, such as the
              GABAergic chandelier cells. This consensus transcriptomic

              analysis showed that the m.5655A $\rightarrow$ G mutation reduced
              the efficiency of tRNA(Ala) precursor 5' end cleavage catalyzed
              by RNase P. By using cybrids constructed by transferring
              mitochondria from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from a
              Chinese family into mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-less ($\rho$(o))
              cells, we showed a 41\% reduction in the steady-state level of
              tRNA(Ala) in mutant cybrids. The mutation caused an improperly
              aminoacylated tRNA(Ala), as suggested by aberrantly aminoacylated
              tRNA(Ala) and slower electrophoretic mobility of mutated tRNA. A
              failure in tRNA(Ala) metabolism contributed to variable
              reductions in six mtDNA-encoded polypeptides in mutant cells,
              ranging from 21\% to 37.5\%, with an average of a 29.1\%
              reduction, compared to levels of the controls. The impaired
              translation caused reduced activities of mitochondrial
              respiration chains. Furthermore, marked decreases in the levels
              of mitochondrial ATP and membrane potential were observed in
              mutant cells. These caused increases in the production of
              reactive oxygen species in the mutant cybrids. The data provide
              evidence for the association of the tRNA(Ala) 5655A $\rightarrow$
              G mutation with hypertension.",

              has been implicated in various neurological disorders. A
              comprehensive understanding of DNA methylation diversity across
              the entire brain in the context of the brain's 3D spatial
              organization is essential for building a complete molecular atlas
              of brain cell types and understanding their gene regulatory
              landscapes. To this end, we employed optimized single-nucleus
              methylome (snmC-seq3) and multi-omic (snm3C-seq) sequencing
              technologies to generate 301,626 methylomes and 176,003 chromatin
              conformation/methylome joint profiles from 117 dissected regions
              throughout the adult mouse brain. Using iterative clustering and
              integrating with companion whole-brain transcriptome and
              chromatin accessibility datasets, we constructed a
              methylation-based cell type taxonomy that contains 4,673 cell
              groups and 261 cross-modality-annotated subclasses. We identified
              millions of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across the
              genome, representing potential gene regulation elements. Notably,
              we observed spatial cytosine methylation patterns on both genes
              and regulatory elements in cell types within and across brain
              regions. Brain-wide multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ
              hybridization (MERFISH) data validated the association of this
              spatial epigenetic diversity with transcription and allowed the
              mapping of the DNA methylation and topology information into
              anatomical structures more precisely than our dissections.
              Furthermore, multi-scale chromatin conformation diversities occur
              in important neuronal genes, highly associated with DNA
              methylation and transcription changes. Brain-wide cell type
              comparison allowed us to build a regulatory model for each gene,
              linking transcription factors, DMRs, chromatin contacts, and
              downstream genes to establish regulatory networks. Finally,
              intragenic DNA methylation and chromatin conformation patterns
              predicted alternative gene isoform expression observed in a
              companion whole-brain SMART-seq dataset. Our study establishes

              be elucidated. We investigated the gene regulatory programs in

              conformation profiles from a total of over 180,000 cells. For

              conserved gene expression and epigenetic features at multiple
              levels. We find that cell type-specific gene expression evolves

              status at distal candidate cis -regulatory elements (cCREs)
              evolves faster than promoters. Strikingly, transposable elements
              (TEs) contribute to nearly 80\% of the human-specific cCREs in
              cortical cells. Through machine learning, we develop
              sequence-based predictors of cCREs in different species and
              demonstrate that the genomic regulatory syntax is highly

              long-distance axonal projections to allow interactions between
              specific cell types. Here we have used Epi-Retro-Seq to link

              accessibility in 2.3 million individual brain cells from 117
              anatomical dissections. The atlas includes 1.3 million cCREs and
              their chromatin accessibility across 602 distinct brain cell
              populations, adding over 640,000 new cCREs to the most recent
              such annotation in the mouse genome. The mouse brain cCREs are
              moderately conserved in the human brain. The mouse specific

               Computational approaches allow the fusion of diverse single-cell
               data types, but their efficacy is difficult to validate in the
               absence of authentic multi-omic measurements. To comprehensively
               assess the molecular phenotypes of single cells, we devised
               single-nucleus methylcytosine, chromatin accessibility, and
               transcriptome sequencing (snmCAT-seq) and applied it to
               postmortem human frontal cortex tissue. We developed a
               cross-validation approach using multi-modal information to
               validate fine-grained cell types and assessed the effectiveness
               of computational data fusion methods. Correlation analysis in
               individual cells revealed distinct relations between methylation

               accessibility, and conformation for 63 human cortical cell
               types. We reconstructed regulatory lineages for cortical cell

              properties, anatomy and functions. Although recent advances in
              single-cell genomics have led to high-resolution molecular
              characterization of cell type diversity in the brain1, neuronal
              cell types are often studied out of the context of their
              anatomical properties. To improve our understanding of the
              relationship between molecular and anatomical features that
              define cortical neurons, here we combined retrograde labelling
              with single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing to link neural
              epigenomic properties to projections. We examined 11,827 single
              neocortical neurons from 63 cortico-cortical and
              cortico-subcortical long-distance projections. Our results showed
              unique epigenetic signatures of projection neurons that
              correspond to their laminar and regional location and projection
              patterns. On the basis of their epigenomes, intra-telencephalic
              cells that project to different cortical targets could be further
              distinguished, and some layer 5 neurons that project to
              extra-telencephalic targets (L5 ET) formed separate clusters that
              aligned with their axonal projections. Such separation varied
              between cortical areas, which suggests that there are
              area-specific differences in L5 ET subtypes, which were further
              validated by anatomical studies. Notably, a population of
              cortico-cortical projection neurons clustered with L5 ET rather
              than intra-telencephalic neurons, which suggests that a
              population of L5 ET cortical neurons projects to both targets. We
              verified the existence of these neurons by dual retrograde
              labelling and anterograde tracing of cortico-cortical projection
              neurons, which revealed axon terminals in extra-telencephalic
              targets including the thalamus, superior colliculus and pons.
              These findings highlight the power of single-cell epigenomic
              approaches to connect the molecular properties of neurons with
              their anatomical and projection properties.",
